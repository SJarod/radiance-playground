	abstract = {In this video I'm showcasing my sampling strategy that's based on cascades. Cascades that are farther away, contain more information about ray directions, but less information about ray origins -- because of this, each cascade actually takes up exactly the same amount of memory.

In other words, cascades encode information in light probes. Cascade n+1 contains 4x less light probes than cascade n, but each probe is 4x higher resolution.

Note that performance of the algorithm is constant and does not depend on how many light sources there are : each pixel is assumed to have its own luminance and opacity values, GI is calculated in 1920x1080 full res. Also no information is cached : each frame lighting is calculated entirely from scratch, it converges fast enough so that no denoising is needed.

PS this is not unity and not UE, this is my custom vulkan-based framegraph rendering engine, called LegitEngine. The engine itself is open source with a bunch of demos, but this demo is not in the repo (yet?): https://github.com/Raikiri/LegitEngine
The profiler ImGui component that you see in the lower left corner can be used as a standalone: https://github.com/Raikiri/LegitProfiler (you still need to provide it your own time stamps and you need to have a working ImGui setup to use it).},
